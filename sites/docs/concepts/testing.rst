Testing Invoke-using codebases
==============================

Strategies for testing codebases that use Invoke; some applicable to code
focused on CLI tasks, and others applicable to more generic/refactored setups.


Subclass & modify Invoke 'internals'
====================================

A quick foreword: most users will find the subsequent approaches suitable, but
advanced users should note that Invoke has been designed so it is itself easily
testable. This means that in many cases, even Invoke's "internals" are exposed
as low/no-shared-responsibility, publicly documented classes which can be
subclassed and modified to inject test-friendly values or mocks. Be sure to
look over the :ref:`API documentation <api>`!


Use `.MockContext`
==================

An instance of subclassing Invoke's public API for test purposes is our own
`.MockContext`. Codebases which revolve heavily around `.Context` objects and
their methods (most task-oriented code) will find it easy to test by injecting
`.MockContext` objects which have been instantiated to yield partial `.Result`
objects.

For example, take this task::

    from invoke import task

    @task
    def get_platform(c):
        uname = c.run("uname -s").stdout.strip()
        if uname == 'Darwin':
            return "You paid the Apple tax!"
        elif uname == 'Linux':
            return "Year of Linux on the desktop!"

An example of testing it with `.MockContext` could be the following::

    from invoke import MockContext, Result
    from mytasks import get_platform

    def test_get_platform_on_mac():
        c = MockContext(run=Result("Darwin\n"))
        assert "Apple" in get_platform(c)

    def test_get_platform_on_linux():
        c = MockContext(run=Result("Linux\n"))
        assert "desktop" in get_platform(c)

Putting the ``Mock`` in `.MockContext`
--------------------------------------

Starting in Invoke 1.5, `.MockContext` will attempt to import the ``mock``
library at instantiation time and wrap its methods within ``Mock`` objects.
This lets you not only present realistic return values to your code, but make
test assertions about what commands your code is running.

Here's another "platform sensitive" task, being tested with the assumption that
the test environment has some flavor of ``mock`` installed (here we'll pretend
it's Python 3.6 or later, and also use some f-strings for brevity)::

    from invoke import task

    @task
    def replace(c, path, search, replacement):
        # Assume systems have sed, and that some (eg macOS w/ Homebrew) may
        # have gsed, implying regular sed is BSD style.
        has_gsed = c.run("which gsed", warn=True, hide=True)
        # Set command to run accordingly
        binary = "gsed" if has_gsed else "sed"
        c.run(f"{binary} -e 's/{search}/{replacement}/g' {path}")

The test code (again, which presumes that eg ``MockContext.run`` is now a
``Mock`` wrapper) relies primarily on 'last call' assertions
(``Mock.assert_called_with``) but you can of course use any ``Mock`` methods
you need. It also shows how you can set the mock context to respond to multiple
possible commands, using a dict value::

    from invoke import MockContext, Result
    from mytasks import replace

    def test_regular_sed():
        expected_sed = "sed -e s/foo/bar/g file.txt"
        c = MockContext(run={
            "which gsed": Result(exited=1),
            expected_sed: Result(),
        })
        replace(c, 'file.txt', 'foo', 'bar')
        c.run.assert_called_with(expected_sed)

    def test_homebrew_gsed():
        expected_sed = "gsed -e s/foo/bar/g file.txt"
        c = MockContext(run={
            "which gsed": Result(exited=0),
            expected_sed: Result(),
        })
        replace(c, 'file.txt', 'foo', 'bar')
        c.run.assert_called_with(expected_sed)

Boolean and string mock results
-------------------------------

You may have noticed the above example uses a handful of 'empty' `.Result`
objects; these stand in for "succeeded, but otherwise had no useful attributes"
command executions (as `.Result` defaults to an exit code of ``0`` and empty
strings for stdout/stderr).

This is relatively common - think "interrogative" commands where the caller
only cares for a boolean result, or times when a command is called purely for
its side effects. To support this, there's a shorthand in `.MockContext`:
passing ``True`` or ``False`` to stand in for otherwise blank Results with exit
codes of ``0`` or ``1`` respectively.

The example tests then look like this::

    from invoke import MockContext, Result
    from mytasks import replace

    def test_regular_sed():
        expected_sed = "sed -e s/foo/bar/g file.txt"
        c = MockContext(run={
            "which gsed": False,
            expected_sed: True,
        })
        replace(c, 'file.txt', 'foo', 'bar')
        c.run.assert_called_with(expected_sed)

    def test_homebrew_gsed():
        expected_sed = "gsed -e s/foo/bar/g file.txt"
        c = MockContext(run={
            "which gsed": True,
            expected_sed: True,
        })
        replace(c, 'file.txt', 'foo', 'bar')
        c.run.assert_called_with(expected_sed)

On top of that, you may also use string values as shorthand for a command's
standard output::

    from invoke import MockContext
    
    TK : short example showing this...maybe NOT based on above lol



Regular expression command matching
-----------------------------------

The dict form of `.MockContext` kwarg can accept regular expression objects in
addition to strings, ideal for situations where you either don't know the exact
command being invoked, or simply don't need or want to write out the entire
thing::

    from invoke import MockContext

Reproducible results
--------------------

TK: reproducible kwarg



Expect `Results <.Result>`
==========================

The core Invoke subprocess methods like `~.Context.run` all return `.Result`
objects - which (as seen above) can be readily instantiated by themselves with
only partial data (e.g. standard output, but no exit code or standard error).

This means that well-organized code can be even easier to test and doesn't
require as much use of `.MockContext`.

An iteration on the initial `.MockContext`-using example above::

    from invoke import task

    @task
    def get_platform(c):
        print(platform_response(c.run("uname -s")))

    def platform_response(result):
        uname = result.stdout.strip()
        if uname == 'Darwin':
            return "You paid the Apple tax!"
        elif uname == 'Linux':
            return "Year of Linux on the desktop!"

With the logic encapsulated in a subroutine, you can just unit test that
function by itself, deferring testing of the task or its context::

    from invoke import Result
    from mytasks import platform_response

    def test_platform_response_on_mac():
        assert "Apple" in platform_response(Result("Darwin\n"))

    def test_platform_response_on_linux():
        assert "desktop" in platform_response(Result("Linux\n"))


Avoid mocking dependency code paths altogether
==============================================

This is more of a general software engineering tactic, but the natural endpoint
of the above code examples would be where your primary logic doesn't care about
Invoke at all -- only about basic Python (or locally defined) data types. This
allows you to test logic in isolation and either ignore testing the Invoke side
of things, or write targeted tests solely for where your code interfaces with
Invoke.

Another minor tweak to the task code::

    from invoke import task

    @task
    def show_platform(c):
        uname = c.run("uname -s").stdout.strip()
        print(platform_response(uname))

    def platform_response(uname):
        if uname == 'Darwin':
            return "You paid the Apple tax!"
        elif uname == 'Linux':
            return "Year of Linux on the desktop!"

And the tests::

    from mytasks import platform_response

    def test_platform_response_on_mac():
        assert "Apple" in platform_response("Darwin\n")

    def test_platform_response_on_linux():
        assert "desktop" in platform_response("Linux\n")
